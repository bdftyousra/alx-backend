# Queueing System In JavaScript

This project contains tasks for learning to create a queueing system in JavaScript.

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **Install a redis instance**
  + Download, extract, and compile the latest stable Redis version (higher than 5.0.7 - [https://redis.io/download](https://redis.io/download)):
    ```powershell
    wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
    tar xzf redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
    cd redis-6.0.10
    make MALLOC=libc # for Linux systems
    # make MALLOC=jemalloc # for Mac OS X systems
    ```
    + Start Redis in the background with `src/redis-server`.
    + Make sure that the server is working with a ping `src/redis-cli ping`.
    + Using the Redis client again, set the value `School` for the key `Holberton`.
    + Kill the server with the process id of the redis-server (hint: use ps and grep).
  + Copy the [`dump.rdb`](dump.rdb) from the `redis-6.0.10` directory into the root of this project.
  + **Requirements:**
    + Running `get Holberton` in the client, should return `School`.

+ [x] 1. **Node Redis Client**
  + Install [node_redis](https://github.com/redis/node-redis) using yarn or npm.
  + Using Babel and ES6, write a script named [`0-redis_client.js`](0-redis_client.js). It should connect to the Redis server running on your machine:
    + It should log to the console the message `Redis client connected to the server` when the connection to Redis works correctly.
    + It should log to the console the message `Redis client not connected to the server: ERROR_MESSAGE` when the connection to Redis does not work.
  + **Requirements:**
    + To import the library, you need to use the keyword `import`.

+ [x] 2. **Node Redis client and basic operations**
  + In a file [`1-redis_op.js`](1-redis_op.js), copy the code you previously wrote ([`0-redis_client.js`](0-redis_client.js)).
  + Add two functions:
    + `setNewSchool`:
      + It accepts two arguments `schoolName`, and `value`.
      + It should set in Redis the value for the key `schoolName`.
      + It should display a confirmation message using `redis.print`.
    + `displaySchoolValue`:
      + It accepts one argument `schoolName`.
      + It should log to the console the value for the key passed as argument.
  + At the end of the file, call:
    + `displaySchoolValue('Holberton');`.
    + `setNewSchool('HolbertonSanFrancisco', '100');`.
    + `displaySchoolValue('HolbertonSanFrancisco');`.
  + **Requirements:**
    + Use callbacks for any of the operation, we will look at async operations later.

+ [x] 3. **Node Redis client and async operations**
  + In a file [`2-redis_op_async.js`](2-redis_op_async.js), copy the code from the previous exercise ([`1-redis_op.js`](1-redis_op.js)).
  + Using `promisify`, modify the function `displaySchoolValue` to use ES6's `async / await`.
  + Same result as [`1-redis_op.js`](1-redis_op.js).

+ [x] 4. **Node Redis client and advanced operations**
  + In a file named [`4-redis_advanced_op.js`](4-redis_advanced_op.js), use the client to store a hash value.
  + **Create Hash:**
    + Using `hset`, let's store the following:
      + The key of the hash should be `HolbertonSchools`.
      + It should have a value for:
        + `Portland=50`.
        + `Seattle=80`.
        + `New York=20`.
        + `Bogota=20`.
        + `Cali=40`.
        + `Paris=2`.
      + Make sure you use `redis.print` for each `hset`.
  + **Display Hash:**
    + Using `hgetall`, display the object stored in Redis. It should return the following:
      ```powershell
      bob@dylan:~$ yarn dev 4-redis_advanced_op.js

      > queuing_system_in_js@1.0.0 dev /root
      > nodemon --exec babel-node --presets @babel/preset-env "4-redis_advanced_op.js"

      {
        Portland: '50',
        Seattle: '80',
        'New York': '20',
        Bogota: '20',
        Cali: '40',
        Paris: '2'
      }
      ^C
      bob@dylan:~$
      ```
  + **Requirements:**
    + Use callbacks for any of the operation, we will look at async operations later.

+ [x] 5. **Node Redis client publisher and subscriber**
  + In a file named [`5-subscriber.js`](5-subscriber.js), create a redis client:
    + On connect, it should log the message `Redis client connected to the server`.
    + On error, it should log the message `Redis client not connected to the server: ERROR MESSAGE`.
    + It should subscribe to the channel `holberton school channel`.
    + When it receives message on the channel `holberton school channel`, it should log the message to the console.
    + When the message is `KILL_SERVER`, it should unsubscribe and quit.
  + In a file named [5-publisher.js](5-publisher.js), create a redis client:
    + On connect, it should log the message `Redis client connected to the server`.
    + On error, it should log the message Redis client not connected to the server: ERROR MESSAGE.
    + Write a function named `publishMessage`:
      + It will take two arguments: `message` (string) and `time` (integer - in ms).
      + After `time` millisecond:
        + The function should log to the console `About to send MESSAGE`.
        + The function should publish to the channel `holberton school channel`, the message passed in argument after the time passed in arguments.
    + At the end of the file, call:
      ```js
      publishMessage("Holberton Student #1 starts course", 100);
      publishMessage("Holberton Student #2 starts course", 200);
      publishMessage("KILL_SERVER", 300);
      publishMessage("Holberton Student #3 starts course", 400);
      ```
  + **Requirements:**
    + You only need one Redis server to execute the program.
    + You will need to have two node processes to run each script at the same time.
  + Now you have a basic Redis-based queuing system where you have a process to generate job and a second one to process it. These 2 processes can be in 2 different servers, which we also call "background workers".

+ [x] 6. **Create the Job creator**
  + In a file named [`6-job_creator.js`](6-job_creator.js):
    + Create a queue with `Kue`.
    + Create an object containing the Job data with the following format:
      ```js
      {
        phoneNumber: string,
        message: string,
      }
      ```
    + Create a queue named `push_notification_code`, and create a job with the object created before.
    + When the job is created without error, log to the console `Notification job created: JOB ID`.
    + When the job is completed, log to the console `Notification job completed`.
    + When the job is failing, log to the console `Notification job failed`.
  + Nothing else will happen - to process the job, go to the next task!
  + If you execute multiple time this file, you will see the `JOB ID` increasing - it means you are storing new job to processâ€¦

+ [x] 7. **Create the Job processor**
  + In a file named [`6-job_processor.js`](6-job_processor.js):
  + Create a queue with `Kue`.
  + Create a function named `sendNotification`:
    + It will take two arguments `phoneNumber` and `message`.
    + It will log to the console `Sending notification to PHONE_NUMBER, with message: MESSAGE`.
  + Write the queue process that will listen to new jobs on `push_notification_code`:
    + Every new job should call the `sendNotification` function with the phone number and the message contained within the job data.
  + **Requirements:**
    + You only need one Redis server to execute the program.
    + You will need to have two node processes to run each script at the same time.
    + You must use `Kue` to set up the queue.
  + [`6-job_processor.js`](6-job_processor.js) and [`6-job_creator.js`](6-job_creator.js) are the same as [`5-subscriber.js`](5-subscriber.js) and [`5-publisher.js`](5-publisher.js) respectively but with a module to manage jobs.

+ [x] 8. **Track progress and errors with Kue: Create the Job creator**
  + In a file named [`7-job_creator.js`](7-job_creator.js):
    + Create an array `jobs` with the following data inside:
      ```js
      const jobs = [
        {
          phoneNumber: '4153518780',
          message: 'This is the code 1234 to verify your account'
        },
        {
          phoneNumber: '4153518781',
          message: 'This is the code 4562 to verify your account'
        },
        {
          phoneNumber: '4153518743',
          message: 'This is the code 4321 to verify your account'
        },
        {
          phoneNumber: '4153538781',
          message: 'This is the code 4562 to verify your account'
        },
        {
          phoneNumber: '4153118782',
          message: 'This is the code 4321 to verify your account'
        },
        {
          phoneNumber: '4153718781',
          message: 'This is the code 4562 to verify your account'
        },
        {
          phoneNumber: '4159518782',
          message: 'This is the code 4321 to verify your account'
        },
        {
          phoneNumber: '4158718781',
          message: 'This is the code 4562 to verify your account'
        },
        {
          phoneNumber: '4153818782',
          message: 'This is the code 4321 to verify your account'
        },
        {
          phoneNumber: '4154318781',
          message: 'This is the code 4562 to verify your account'
        },
        {
          phoneNumber: '4151218782',
          message: 'This is the code 4321 to verify your account'
        }
      ];
      ```
    + After this array has been created:
      + Create a queue with `Kue`.
      + Write a loop that will go through the array `jobs` and for each object:
        + Create a new job to the queue `push_notification_code_2` with the current object.
        + If there is no error, log to the console `Notification job created: JOB_ID`.
        + On the job completion, log to the console `Notification job JOB_ID completed`.
        + On the job failure, log to the console `Notification job JOB_ID failed: ERROR`.
        + On the job progress, log to the console `Notification job JOB_ID PERCENTAGE% complete`.

+ [x] 9. **Track progress and errors with Kue: Create the Job processor**
  + In a file named [`7-job_processor.js`](7-job_processor.js):
    + Create an array that will contain the blacklisted phone numbers. Add in it `4153518780` and `4153518781` - these 2 numbers will be blacklisted by our jobs processor.
    + Create a function `sendNotification` that takes 4 arguments: `phoneNumber`, `message`, `job`, and `done`:
      + When the function is called, track the progress of the `job` of `0` out of `100`.
      + If `phoneNumber` is included in the "blacklisted array", fail the job with an `Error` object and the message: `Phone number PHONE_NUMBER is blacklisted`.
      + Otherwise:
        + Track the progress to 50%.
        + Log to the console `Sending notification to PHONE_NUMBER, with message: MESSAGE`.
    + Create a queue with Kue that will process job of the queue `push_notification_code_2` with two jobs at a time.
  + **Requirements:**
    + You only need one Redis server to execute the program.
    + You will need to have two node processes to run each script at the same time.
    + You must use `Kue` to set up the queue.
    + Executing the jobs list should log to the console the following:
      + Terminal 2:
      ```powershell
      bob@dylan:~$ yarn dev 7-job_processor.js

      > queuing_system_in_js@1.0.0 dev /root
      > nodemon --exec babel-node --presets @babel/preset-env "7-job_processor.js"

        Notification job #49 50% complete
        Notification job #49 completed
        ```

+ [x] 10. **Writing the job creation function**
  + In a file named [`8-job.js`](8-job.js), create a function named `createPushNotificationsJobs`:
    + It takes in two arguments: `jobs` (array of objects) and `queue` (`Kue` queue).
    + If `jobs` is not an array, it should throw an `Error` with message: `Jobs is not an array`.
    + For each job in `jobs`, create a job in the queue `push_notification_code_3`.
    + When a job is created, it should log to the console `Notification job created: JOB_ID`.
    + When a job is complete, it should log to the console `Notification job JOB_ID completed`.
    + When a job is failed, it should log to the console `Notification job JOB_ID failed: ERROR`.
    + When a job is making progress, it should log to the console `Notification job JOB_ID PERCENT% complete`.

+ [x] 11. **Writing the test for job creation**
  + Now that you have created a job creator, let's add tests:
    + Import the function `createPushNotificationsJobs`.
    + Create a queue with `Kue`.
    + Write a test suite for the `createPushNotificationsJobs` function:
      + Use `queue.testMode` to validate which jobs are inside the queue.
      + etc.
  + **Requirements:**
    + Make sure to enter the test mode without processing the jobs before executing the tests.
    + Make sure to clear the queue and exit the test mode after executing the tests.

+ [x] 12. **In stock?**
  + **Data**
    + Create an array `listProducts` containing the list of the following products:
      + Id: 1, name: `Suitcase 250`, price: 50, stock: 4.
      + Id: 2, name: `Suitcase 450`, price: 100, stock: 10.
      + Id: 3, name: `Suitcase 650`, price: 350, stock: 2.
      + Id: 4, name: `Suitcase 1050`, price: 550, stock: 5.
  + **Data access**
    + Create a function named `getItemById`:
      + It will take `id` as argument.
      + It will return the item from `listProducts` with the same id.
  + **Server**
    + Create an `express` server listening on the port 1245. (You will start it via: `yarn dev 9-stock.js`).
  + **Products**
    + Create the route `GET /list_products` that will return the list of every available product with the following JSON format:
      ```powershell
      bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/list_products ; echo ""
      [{"itemId":1,"itemName":"Suitcase 250","price":50,"initialAvailableQuantity":4},{"itemId":2,"itemName":"Suitcase 450","price":100,"initialAvailableQuantity":10},{"itemId":3,"itemName":"Suitcase 650","price":350,"initialAvailableQuantity":2},{"itemId":4,"itemName":"Suitcase 1050","price":550,"initialAvailableQuantity":5}]
      bob@dylan:~$
      ```
  + **In stock in Redis**
    + Create a client to connect to the Redis server:
      + Write a function `reserveStockById` that will take `itemId` and `stock` as arguments:
        + It will set in Redis the stock for the key `item.ITEM_ID`.
      + Write an async function `getCurrentReservedStockById`, that will take `itemId` as an argument:
        + It will return the reserved stock for a specific item.
  + **Product detail**
    + Create the route `GET /list_products/:itemId`, that will return the current product and the current available stock (by using `getCurrentReservedStockById`) with the following JSON format:
      ```powershell
      bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/list_products/1 ; echo ""
      {"itemId":1,"itemName":"Suitcase 250","price":50,"initialAvailableQuantity":4,"currentQuantity":4}
      bob@dylan:~$
      ```
    + If the item does not exist, it should return:
      ```powershell
      bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/list_products/12 ; echo ""
      {"status":"Product not found"}
      bob@dylan:~$
      ```
  + **Reserve a product**
    + Create the route `GET /reserve_product/:itemId`:
      + If the item does not exist, it should return:
        ```powershell
        bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/reserve_product/12 ; echo ""
        {"status":"Product not found"}
        bob@dylan:~$
        ```
      + If the item exists, it should check that there is at least one stock available. If not it should return:
        ```powershell
        bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/reserve_product/1 ; echo ""
        {"status":"Not enough stock available","itemId":1}
        bob@dylan:~$
        ```
      + If there is enough stock available, it should reserve one item (by using `reserveStockById`), and return:
        ```powershell
        bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/reserve_product/1 ; echo ""
        {"status":"Reservation confirmed","itemId":1}
        bob@dylan:~$
        ```
  + **Requirements:**
    + Make sure to use `promisify` with Redis.
    + Make sure to use the `await`/`async` keyword to get the value from Redis.
    + Make sure the format returned by the web application is always JSON and not text.

+ [x] 13. **Can I have a seat?**
  + **Redis**
    + Create a Redis client:
      + Create a function `reserveSeat`, that will take the argument `number`, and set the key `available_seats` with the `number`.
      + Create a function `getCurrentAvailableSeats`, it will return the current number of available seats (by using `promisify` for Redis).
      + When launching the application, set the number of available to 50.
      + Initialize the boolean `reservationEnabled` to `true` - it will be turned to `false` when no seat will be available.
  + **`Kue` queue**
    + Create a `Kue` queue.
  + **Server**
    + Create an express server listening on port 1245. (You will start it via: `yarn dev 100-seat.js`).
    + Add the route GET /available_seats that returns the number of seats available:
      ```powershell
      bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/available_seats ; echo ""
      {"numberOfAvailableSeats":"50"}
      bob@dylan:~$
      ```
    + Add the route `GET /reserve_seat` that:
      + Returns `{ "status": "Reservation are blocked" }` if `reservationEnabled` is `false`.
      + Creates and queues a job in the queue `reserve_seat`:
        + Save the job and return:
          + `{ "status": "Reservation in process" }` if no error.
          + Otherwise: `{ "status": "Reservation failed" }`.
        + When the job is completed, print in the console: `Seat reservation job JOB_ID completed`.
        + When the job failed, print in the console: `Seat reservation job JOB_ID failed: ERROR_MESSAGE`.
    + Add the route `GET /process` that:
      + Returns `{ "status": "Queue processing" }` just after:
      + Process the queue `reserve_seat` (async):
        + Decrease the number of seat available by using `getCurrentAvailableSeats` and `reserveSeat`.
        + If the new number of available seats is equal to 0, set `reservationEnabled` to false.
        + If the new number of available seats is more or equal than 0, the job is successful.
        + Otherwise, fail the job with an `Error` with the message `Not enough seats available`.
  + **Requirements:**
    + Make sure to use `promisify` with Redis.
    + Make sure to use the `await`/`async` keyword to get the value from Redis.
    + Make sure the format returned by the web application is always JSON and not text.
    + Make sure that only the allowed amount of seats can be reserved.
    + Make sure that the main route is displaying the right number of seats.
